- this text contains the instructions on how to classify the burn injuries in the patient described in the medical note
- the instructions are in english, but since the texts are in european portuguese I'll provide portuguese expressions that have the same meaning when this is not clear. These will be in brackets separated by comma if there are several, after the english expression. 

# burn depth
- first-degree burn (queimadura de 1º grau, 1ºG)
	- superficial
- second-degree burn (queimadura de 2º grau, 2ºG)
	- can be either
		- superficial
			- blisters, painful, moist
		- deep
			- blisters easily unroofed, less painful, dry
- third-degree (queimadura de 3º grau, 3ºG)
	- full thickness
- fourth-degree
	- extends beyond skin to involve underlying tissues
		- such as muscle and bone

# burn size
- described in percentage of body surface area
- sum it up with total body surface area - TBSA (área total de superfície corporal, ASC)
	- burned body surface area (ASCQ) 
- the percentage % sign is often used
- sometimes the number is preceded by  tilde ~ to mean "roughly" (cerca de)

# burn location
- described as body locations
- The locations are described in the following table with 2 columns. The first column is the burn location. The second column is the SNOMED CT code.
